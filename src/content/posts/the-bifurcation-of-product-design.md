This week I attended [Hatch Conference](https://hatchconference.com) in Berlin to run a 'Designer to Founder' round table. It was the first design conference I'd attended since 2019 when I spoke at Jam London (aah, pre covid days).

In the intervening years — while I've done a bunch of design work, I've not had a designer title or really any opportunity to just nerd out with my people so I was excited to catch up on the latest hotness from this conference aimed at senior designers.

The product design discipline, as with many others, is in flux right now. I previously wrote about a [new way of working](/designing-closer-to-the-edge) unlocked by this emergent technical landscape, but the existential questions being asked of — and by — the design community was in full force in Berlin.

Most talks I attended referenced AI, either directly or implied — whether designing for new AI-driven paradgims or using AI as part of a design process. What was common across all, was that after years of playing around the edges of a design process that fundamentally hasn't changed since the double diamond, there's a real opportunity here to question everything.

A theme not directly mentioned by any of the speakers that I saw, but that I sensed across the day, was one of an unbundling of the 'Product Designer' skillset.

### Unbundling of the title

Ben Thompson coined the phrase 'Aggregation Theory' in reference to businesses bundling and unbundling continuously. This natural process, where many small challenger companies build interesting technology only to ultimately be consumed by (or become) broader platforms, plays out over and over again.

But the same is true of skills. What once was a UX vs a UI designer became a product designer: bundling. What once was a front end and back end developer increasingly warped into a full stack as technology moved the skills closer together. Not true of everyone, but for companies needing expensive designers and developers, the convenience of hiring one 'double threat' was compelling.

Now we're seeing AI unlock new capabilities at the edges of the traditional Product Design skillset. Not only can a designer build prototypes, even production code with the support of Cursor, Claude and Figma Make, but also ideate radical and — until now — time consuming new directions in minutes with the latest image models.

This led to two, fairly distinct narratives in the room.

Emmet Connoly from Intercom evangelised the 'technical designer' skillset. As Intercom pivoted the business to Fin, their customer support agent, they were also upending the ways of working with every designer expected to ship production code in Q2 2025.

Meanwhile Cam Worbouys, head of product design at Cash App, spoke passionately about 'throwing ideas into Goose' (Block's agent runner) to generate walls of new visual ideas in minutes. To Cam, designers are primarily taste makers.

Jenny Wen who led the design of Figjam and is now designing Claude showed both sides, with the Figma team being more exploratory and creative, while the Anthropic design team is highly technical.

### Where's your energy?

To me these archetypes, while possible for one person to learn, feel fundamentally different. Like, different sides of the brain. Artistic, creative, exploratory, visual led vs logical building led mindsets.

I suspect most designers will truly only get energy from one or the other.

This might even be at the heart of the 'should designers code' debate that now feels kind of retro. Perhaps all along we were talking about different people, and the real answer is that for some of us yes, and for others, no.

So this leads me to wonder — are we headed for a world in which job titles fully bifurcate into 'Technical Designer' (or Design Engineer), focused on designing and building the UI, and 'Creative Designer' (or Art director?) tasked with bringing an experience to life in new delightful and unique ways?

And if so, how many of each will any team need? And where will they come from? I for one would love to see someone step from a different discipline into the creative side, without fear of having to learn how to build good Figma components.

Finally, how do these groups work together to build something that truly makes sense for an end user?

One thing I'm convinced of — for designers wanting to create at the edge of what's possible in this moment of pure invention, they're going to have to embrace a new path. A path that involves both deep instrospection and a growth mindset.

That makes it for my money the most exciting time to be a designer, for those watching closely.
