## The Challenge
- Why I wanted to turn my Rails web app into a mobile app
- My lack of mobile development experience
- Setting reasonable expectations for a week-long project

## My Approach
- Why I chose React Native over native iOS development
- The tools I selected (Cursor, Claude's Sonnet 3.7)
- Setting up the development environment and API layer

## The Development Journey
- Day 1: Setting up the API and first React Native components
- Day 2: Authentication and styling challenges
- Day 3: The frustrating build issues and AI's limitations
- Day 4: Getting to a working demo

## What Worked Well
- Areas where AI excelled (API integration, styling, problem-solving)
- The "vibe coding" approach that felt most productive
- Moments of unexpected breakthroughs

## What Didn't Work
- Areas where AI fell short (build configuration, dependency issues)
- The limitations of context and hallucinations
- When AI should have said "I don't know"

## Personal Reflections
- How this experience compared to traditional development
- The strange relationship with AI as a coding partner
- What I learned about my own development preferences and style

## What's Next
- Plans for improving the birthday app
- How I'll approach AI-assisted development in the future
- Broader thoughts on the future of software development
