There's something delightfully recursive about writing a blog post, on my phone, about how I can now write blog posts on my phone.

When Anthropic announced Claude Code for iOS, I was curious but skeptical. Could a mobile coding experience actually be useful, or was it just a nice-to-have feature that would gather digital dust? After using it to write this very post, I'm pleasantly surprised.

## The Context

I've been maintaining this blog as an Astro site for a while now. My typical workflow for creating new posts has involved:

1. Opening my laptop
2. Firing up Cursor or another editor
3. Creating a new markdown file with the right frontmatter
4. Writing the content
5. Committing and pushing to Git

It's not complicated, but it requires me to be at my desk with my laptop open. And let's be honest – some of the best ideas come when you're nowhere near your desk.

## Enter Claude Code on iOS

The iOS app brings Claude Code's capabilities to my pocket. Not in a watered-down, "mobile-friendly" way, but with full access to the same tools and workflows I use on desktop.

Here's what I can do:

**Full Git Integration**: I can create branches, commit changes, and push to remote repositories. The app handles all the git operations I'd normally run from the terminal.

**File System Access**: Claude can navigate my repository, read existing posts to understand the format, and create new files with the proper structure and frontmatter.

**Complete Markdown Editing**: Writing long-form content on a phone isn't ideal, but Claude helps by understanding context, maintaining consistent voice, and formatting everything correctly.

**Real Development Workflow**: This isn't just note-taking that I'll clean up later. Claude Code can handle the entire process from creation to deployment.

## Writing This Post

To write this post, I:

1. Opened Claude Code on my iPhone
2. Asked Claude to explore the blog structure
3. Told it to write a post about writing posts with Claude Code on iOS
4. Reviewed and refined the content (yes, meta-inception here)
5. Committed and pushed to my blog repository

The entire process took maybe 10 minutes. I'm sitting on my couch, and this post will be live shortly after I push it.

## What's Different About Mobile

The interesting thing isn't just that I *can* do this on mobile – it's that the experience makes sense. The conversational interface actually works better on a phone than traditional code editors would.

I'm not hunting for menus or struggling with mobile keyboard shortcuts. I'm just having a conversation about what I want to create, and Claude handles the implementation details.

The limitations are real – reviewing large diffs or working with complex file structures isn't ideal on a small screen. But for focused tasks like writing a blog post, editing documentation, or making small updates, it's genuinely useful.

## The Broader Implications

This feels like a glimpse of a different way of working. Not replacing desktop development, but complementing it.

I can capture ideas when they're fresh, make quick fixes when I spot issues, or publish content from anywhere. The friction between "having an idea" and "shipping it" just got a lot lower.

It's the kind of tool that seems trivial until you start using it. Then you realize you're creating and shipping things in moments that would have otherwise been lost to "I'll do that when I get to my laptop" (which often means never).

## The Meta Layer

There's something fitting about using AI to write about using AI. This post exists because the tool I'm writing about made it possible to write it in the first place.

Is it perfect? No. Did Claude write every word exactly as I'd have written it? Also no. But it captured the essence of what I wanted to express, in my voice, formatted correctly for my blog, committed to the right branch, and ready to publish.

That's pretty remarkable for something I did from my couch on a Sunday afternoon.

## What's Next

I'm curious to see how this changes my writing habits. Will I publish more frequently? Write shorter, more immediate posts? Use my phone for more substantial development work?

I don't know yet. But I like that the option is there.

For now, I'm going to commit this post, push it to my blog, and marvel at the fact that I just meta-blogged about meta-blogging from a device in my pocket.

The future is weird, and I'm here for it.
