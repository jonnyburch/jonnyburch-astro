## First thoughts on the chatGPT browser and the proliferation of chat

First of all, I quite like chatGPT Atlas. It doesn't have the 'profiles' feature thaat Chrome, Dia et al have, which I would personally need to be my daily driver. But it's really nicely executed, the cool overlay when the browser is being automated by openAI is pretty, and it feels like a logical progression in the move up the stack to being the new front page of the internet.

But I found that by moving what I've always compartmentalised as a website (chatGPT) onto the browser layer, I felt a bit of cognitive dissonance.

You log in with chatGPT as soon as you fire up the browser, and as a result all your chats (basically the entirety of chatGPT) is right there, in your sidebar. That means every web search in Atlas that chatGPT deems to be 'a chat' turns up in chatGPT.

I _think_ I'm ok with this? I feel like my chatGPT sidebar is throwaway enough that I don't mind filling it with random searches. But equally the Dia sidebar which doesn't sync in that way feels nicely compartmentalised.

If I squint I can start to see the productivity gains from seamlessly moving from my memories in chatGPT to my browsing history and back â€” and this is a great v1. But right now. I dunno. Maybe it's nicer to have different AIs that I talk to about different things. Gemini can improve my writing in Google docs, while Claude handles my conversations about code (Claude Code in the browser is a whole other topic...).
