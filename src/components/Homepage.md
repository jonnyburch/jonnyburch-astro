I'm a designer, product wonk, founder and reader of internets. Currently tinkering as [Toy Studio](https://toy.studio).
Until very recently I was CEO of [Progression](https://progression.co), the worlds first career pathway management platform. [We got acquired in September 2024](https://progression.co/blog/progression-is-joining-the-career-io-family/) and I remain both immensely proud of what we achieved and very pleased that it's now in good hands.

(I'll probably write more about my 6 year journey as a founder — aka all my fu*kups — in good time.)

Before all that I led consumer design at now foodicorn [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk) [(LON:ROO)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ROO:LON?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwivtq-vmqGHAxV0TEEAHTLMCAQQ3ecFegQIMBAX) for a bit, [powered £1.8m+ of donations for 300k+ NHS staff meals](https://mealsforthenhs.org) during covid, helped to build a bank for children that made [ahem, headlines](https://https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714436/Debit-card-lets-children-buy-porn-alcohol-weapons-blocked-thanks-Mail-Sunday.html), published 6 issues and 15,000 copies of a [sweary magazine for creative graduates](https://shellsuitzombie.co.uk) that my dad disapproved of and organised a [30 day creative festival](https://vimeo.com/82980736) on a dime in the middle of Shoreditch. I also [interviewed Goldie](https://jonnyburch.com/goldie-interview/) and watched him chainsaw a tree, which was nice.

I can mainly be found online on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jonnyburch.com) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jonnyburch) or adding occasional longer updates on this site (see below).
